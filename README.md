# RAG Evaluations

Welcome to my exploration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) evaluation techniques and chunking strategies. This site documents my journey understanding how different approaches to document chunking affect RAG system performance.

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive exploration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) evaluation techniques and chunking strategies. The content focuses on comparing different approaches to document chunking and their impact on RAG system performance as measured by specialized evaluation metrics.

## Content

The site includes detailed information on:

- **RAG Chunking Strategies**: Comparing naive and semantic chunking approaches
- **Evaluation with RAGAS**: Using specialized metrics for RAG assessment
- **Result Comparisons**: Analyzing the impact of different chunking strategies
- **Best Practices**: Recommendations for implementing effective RAG systems

## Quick Start

1. Explore the [Introduction](intro.md) for a high-level overview
2. Learn about [RAG Chunking Strategies](rag-chunking-strategies.md)
3. Understand [RAG Evaluation with RAGAS](rag-evaluation-with-ragas.md)
4. Review the [Evaluation Results](rag-chunking-evaluation-results.md)

## Key Findings

- Semantic chunking significantly improves context precision and answer quality
- Different query types benefit differently from chunking strategies
- Trade-offs exist between processing speed and retrieval quality
- Specialized evaluation frameworks like RAGAS provide insights traditional metrics miss
