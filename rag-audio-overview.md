## Overview

The journey begins with an introduction to the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) and how RAG addresses these by integrating external knowledge retrieval. It highlights the significance of effective document chunking strategies and the necessity of rigorous evaluation for RAG systems.

## Phase 1: Building a Baseline RAG System

Phase 1 focuses on building a baseline RAG application using LangGraph. Students will learn the core steps of a minimal RAG pipeline:

1. Loading data
2. Splitting it into chunks using a naive strategy like `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`
3. Storing these chunks in a vector store
4. Retrieving relevant chunks based on a query
5. Generating an answer using an LLM

They'll also be introduced to LangGraph for orchestrating this pipeline as a stateful graph.

## Phase 2: Evaluation with RAGAS

In Phase 2, the focus shifts to evaluating this baseline using RAGAS, a framework specifically designed for RAG assessment. Students will understand the need for RAG-specific metrics beyond traditional NLP evaluation. 

The key RAGAS metrics covered include:
- Faithfulness
- Answer Relevancy
- Context Precision
- Context Recall
- Answer Correctness

This phase details the process of setting up an evaluation dataset and executing the RAGAS evaluation, emphasizing the interpretation of baseline results to identify areas for improvement.

## Phase 3: Semantic Chunking Implementation

Phase 3 delves into implementing a more advanced chunking strategy: semantic chunking using LangChain's `SemanticChunker`. The overview:

- Contrasts naive and semantic chunking approaches
- Explains the embedding-based semantic chunking algorithm
- Guides students through the practical implementation using LangChain
- Highlights key parameters and considerations for effective semantic chunking

---

## Phase 4: Enhanced RAG Pipeline

Phase 4 involves building and evaluating a second RAG application, this time incorporating the semantic chunking strategy within the LangGraph framework. Students will:

1. Learn how to modify the pipeline to use the `SemanticChunker`
2. Re-index the data using the semantic chunking approach
3. Run the same RAGAS evaluation as in Phase 2 on this semantically enhanced pipeline

The overview emphasizes the importance of comparing these new results with the baseline to understand the impact of chunking strategies.

---

## Phase 5: Results Comparison

Finally, Phase 5 centers on a comprehensive comparison of the results obtained with naive and semantic chunking. Students will:

- Analyze the impact of the chunking strategy on the RAGAS metrics
- Consider the trade-offs in complexity and performance
- Understand factors influencing the effectiveness of chunking
- Recognize the limitations of both semantic chunking and RAGAS evaluation

The overview concludes with detailed recommendations for choosing chunking strategies and suggests avenues for further exploration, encouraging students to experiment with different parameters, models, and advanced RAG techniques.
